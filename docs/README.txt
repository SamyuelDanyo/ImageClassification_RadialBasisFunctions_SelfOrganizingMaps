Dependencies:
------------
    Python --version >= 3.7
    Python Standard Library: (time)
    Third Party: (Numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy.io)

    Recommended:
        Please make sure that you have installed Anaconda Python (version >= 3.7) in your environment.
        Information on installing Anaconda:
        < https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ >
        < https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/ >
        < https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/ >

        If you already have Python &/or do not want to install a full distribution:
        Make sure your environment satisfies all the requirements/dependencies listed above.
        
Interactive
-----------
The project is also provided in a Jupyter Notebook, which is a web-based interactive
Python interpreter that allows users to type and run Python code in a web browser.
An example execution is exported to html notebook "ImageClassification_RadialBasisFunctions_SelfOrganizingMaps.html" and can be found in <root/docs>
Please make sure that you satisfy the above-mentioned requirements, Jupyter Notebook will
be installed along with Anaconda.

1. Open Anaconda Prompt (or your Python environment prompt).
2. Navigate to root/src/, home of ImageClassification_RadialBasisFunctions_SelfOrganizingMaps.ipynb
3. Execute < jupyter notebook >
4. Click on the "ImageClassification_RadialBasisFunctions_SelfOrganizingMaps" notebook.
5. Start running the blocks of code sequentially either by clicking the < run cell, select below > button
   or by keys < shift + Enter > while selected the block of code.

Python Command
---------------
Make sure you Python is installed on your command line.
